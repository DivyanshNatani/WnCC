This project aims to create a real time engine capable of rendering an infinite open world terrain with procedural generation with complex cave systems in OpenGL framework.

No. of mentees: 4

Description:
This project is for people interested in the field of Computer Graphics and Rendering and this project will give a very good idea of the rendering pipeline used in modern game engines. The implementation will be using the OpenGL framework in C++. The engine should be capable of the following -
1. Procedural generation of landmass (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation for more details) - It is upto you to make it voxel or continuous
2. 3D cave systems
3. Level of Detail implementation with real time access to change detail of terrain

Reading Material:
Set up openGL:

Getting Started with openGL:

Noise generation for terrain:

Proposal:
Submit a proposal containing the following -
1. Motivation for picking up this project
2. Past experiences with coding - if worked on a large codebase, do mention
3. Past experiences with game development or rendering - it is fine even if no such experience, you will learn from the basics here
4. Additional ideas that can be added - be practical

### Tentative Project Timeline
<!--break-->

|Week Number  | Tasks to be Completed|
|--- | --- | 
|**Week 1** | Set up OpenGL. Learn basics of how objects are displayed - rasterization and clipping. Render a simple triangle on screen |
|**Week 2** |Understand functionality of VAO and VBO. Build a single terrain patch (procedural not necessary at the moment)|
|**Week 3** | Learn perlin noise and generate procedural terrain patch. Add light system - Blinn Phong shading|
|**Week 4** |Add camera to allow for movement in game. Extend terrain to give an infinite landmass generating around view of player|
|**Week 5** |Add shading based on height and biome locations. Preferably add some good textures|
|**Week 6** |Add water bodies with reflection maps|
|**Week 7** |(Bonus) Add cave systems, clouds and other ideas if you have the time|
