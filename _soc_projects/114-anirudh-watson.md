We shall build an app that's smart enough like an assistant to help me know how I spend my time and then help me manage my time. 


<!--break-->

No. of mentees: 4

Description:

What's the screen time of your mobile phone? Have you used an app more than you wanted to? Have you faced trouble developing a positive habit using an app? Do you feel addicted to social media and find it difficult to 'live in the moment'?
If any of these questions mean something to you and you're interested in android development, this project should be worth your attention. 

I wish to see an app that's smart enough like an assistant to help me know how I spend my time and then help me manage my time. Basic (and buggy) prototype of this project is available. Mentees will be first asked to get familiarized with the present code and then begin implementing other features. 

These links are from the ideation phase:

Ideal mentees should have basic ideas about android development and should have made a couple of apps. Kindly share these apps while applying. If you have not done android dev before, you should still apply as long as youâ€™re ready to put in the required efforts.
