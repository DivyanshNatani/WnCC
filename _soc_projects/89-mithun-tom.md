No. of mentees: 5

Have a look at CodeBullet YouTube channel
There are many interesting games solved by RL or deep RL agents
https://youtube.com/c/CodeBullet

Go through the documentation of gym environments.I have implemented a q-learning agent for the Mountain car environment have a look:

Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
Book by Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton is a great book for RL

Prerequisites:
Python programming
Calculus, linear algebra and probability theory
