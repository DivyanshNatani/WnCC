They main idea behind this project is to understand and implement the algorithms used by FaceApp, especially the aging/de-aging filter. Developing an actual app that does this would be a plus point!

Description:
This project will involve learning many machine learning algorithms leading to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are the basis of such filters.

For students who have participated in Summer of Science (Machine Learning track) before, this would be a great hands-on project!
